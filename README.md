# Model analysis on the What-If framework for TensorFlow on Hopsworks

<h4><strong>TL;DR</strong> During my Data Science work at Hopsworks, I wrote the blog about What-If framework by TensorFlow.</h4>
<h3><a href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/model-analysis-what-if-framework-for-tensorflow">https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/model-analysis-what-if-framework-for-tensorflow</a><h3>
<p>The blog introduces how you can use the Google's What-If Tool as a Jupyter plugin on Hopsworks MLOps to</p>
<p>build better machine learning models by making it easier to ask counterfactual questions about your modelâ€™s behavior.</p>
