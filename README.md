# Model analysis on the What-If framework for TensorFlow on Hopsworks

<strong>TL;DR</strong> During my Data Science work at Hopsworks, I wrote the blog about What-If framework by TensorFlow.

The blog introduces how you can use the Google's What-If Tool as a Jupyter plugin on Hopsworks to build better machine learning models by making it easier to ask counterfactual questions about your modelâ€™s behavior.
